*Challenge*: All For One - Build

*Description*:
 Page Structure:
  Develop a 11-page application, with each page dedicated to a specific mini API endpoint challenge, and a home page with links to each page. (except for Guess It)
   Does not have to be in this order:
    1.) Say hello, 2.) Adding, 3.) Asking Questions, 4.) Greater or Less 5.) Madlib 6.) Odd or Even 7.) ReverseIt (alphaNumeric) 8.) reverse it (numbersOnly) 9.) Magic 8 Ball 10.) Restaurant Picker 11.) Home Page
  Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling and layout, ensuring a cohesive and responsive design across all pages.
  
 Input and Display:
  Implement user input fields on each page to gather information from the user relevant to the respective API endpoint.
  Display the information retrieved from the backend in a clear and organized manner on the same page.
  
 API Endpoint Pages:
  Each page should correspond to one of the mini API endpoints, showcasing the unique functionality of that endpoint.
  
 Example: Restaurant Picker Page:
  Description: Create a page where the user can input a restaurant category.
   Functionality: Collect user input for the restaurant category.
   Use the backend API to fetch a random restaurant suggestion based on the provided category.
  Display the restaurant suggestion prominently on the page.
  
 Consistency:
  Maintain a consistent design theme across all pages to ensure a seamless user experience.

*Peer Review*: Really nice site!, the planet and space theme really works well with the simplictic buttons and input fields, and responsiveness works mostly.
in adding two numbers, asking questions, Greater or less, and MadLib the background starts to act weird when transitiong into mobile (around 720 - 900 pixels).
Also the API for madlib doesnt seem to be working, as it gives me a console error when I use it.
